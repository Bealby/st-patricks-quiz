especially
during times when people are unable to socialise in person.

It allows people to test their
knowledge of St. Patrick's Day and the history behind it. All that is required
is for an individual/ group/ family/ household to enter their team name,
answer the 10 questions
and compare their scores with other teams on the leaderboard.

you fair...
